# Manas Mentality
This is just a fun project for me to revise the use of LLMs in projects.

## Project Overview
This is a Streamlit-based AI chatbot that simulates conversations with your friend (here, Manas). The bot is powered by a large language model hosted on [Together.ai](https://www.together.ai/), and it behaves based on a detailed personality profile you provide.

This project is inspired by my friend Manas who is a very hardworking, funny, sarcastic and smart individual. He is a very humble guy and does not boast about his skills at all (even though he is super good at a lottttt of stuff). Maybe he is just unaware of how awesome and hardworking he is or its just him being humble.

This lead to the creation of an inside joke called "Manas Mentality" which is hard to sum up in a few words; but it's basically the ideology that we think Manas functions on. Manas mentality is characterized by consistent hardwork and eagerness to learn. It is the hunger to learn new things and become a master at them. Manas doesn't just stick to being amazing at one thing, he constantly tries to find new things to become good at.
